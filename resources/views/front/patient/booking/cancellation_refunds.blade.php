                <p>Your time and your doctorâ€™s time is important to us, which is why we have a fair cancellation, rescheduling and refund policy.</p>
                <p>You are entitled to a refund if you cancel or reschedule your consultation:</p>

                <ul class="pointsQues">
                    <li>Any time before the doctor confirms your consultation time</li>
                    <li>If there is more than 1 hour remaining until the consultation, and the doctor has confirmed your booking time</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Unfortunately, your booking fee cannot be refunded if you decide to cancel or reschedule with less than 1 hour until your consultation, if the doctor has already confirmed this consultation. This is because the doctor may have missed an opportunity to consult another patient in that same timeslot.</p>
